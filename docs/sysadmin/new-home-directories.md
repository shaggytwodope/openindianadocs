# New Home Directories for new users

These are normally stored in ```/export/home/username``` but ```mounted``` to ```/home``` by a service called ```autofs```.

Once you've [created a ```user```](create-a-user.md) and their ```home folder``` (and given the user ```ownership``` of this folder) you will need to update the ```automount``` script. This is it before the addition.

```bash
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ cat /etc/auto_home

#
# ident "%Z%%M% %I%     %E% SMI"
#
# Home directory map for automounter
#
adrian  localhost:/export/home/&
+auto_home

```

To do this(open your favorite editor):

```bash
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ sudo nano /etc/auto_home # append paul localhost:/export/home/& before +auto_home
```

where paul is the ```user``` and ```home directory``` name.

It should now look like:

```bash
#
# Copyright 2005 Sun Microsystems, Inc.  All rights reserved.
# Use is subject to license terms.
#
# CDDL HEADER START
#

#
# Home directory map for automounter
#
adrian  localhost:/export/home/&
paul    localhost:/export/home/&
+auto_home

```

Then start and stop the service:

```bash
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ sudo svcadm disable autofs
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ sudo svcadm enable autofs
```

Now when you login as that user their home directory will be automounted into the ```/home``` folder.
