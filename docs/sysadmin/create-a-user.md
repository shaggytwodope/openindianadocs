# Create a new user

```bash
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ useradd $USERNAME 
#where username is the name of the user.
```
so e.g.

```bash
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ useradd veek
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ passwd veek 
#to set a password for the user.
```
and you're most of the way there, now refer to ``Making a new home directory``
