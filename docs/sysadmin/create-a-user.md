# Create a new user

```bash
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ useradd $USERNAME
#where username is the name of the user.
```

so e.g.

```bash
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ useradd veek
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ passwd veek
#to set a password for the user.
```

and you're most of the way there, now refer to ``Making a new home directory``
