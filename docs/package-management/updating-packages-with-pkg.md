# Updating Packages with ```pkg```

```
adrian@openindiana-tuts:~$ sudo pkg update 
# you basically just wait, let pkg do it's thing.
# assuming everything went smoothly you'll have all your packages updated, 
# though you need to reboot into a new zfs system image.
# Usually named OpenIndiana-1 instead of OpenIndiana Hipster in the boot menu.
