# Installing OpenIndiana via the text install and ssh

## Boot and setup

In the ``boot menu``, select ``OI hipster Enable SSH``

![select ssh](../images/install/txt/select-ssh.png)

When you get to the desktop open a ``terminak`` and enter

```bash
ifconfig | grep inet
```

This should ``print`` something like

```bash
inet 127.0.0.1 netmask ff000000
inet 192.168.0.20 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255 # could be 10.0.0.x or another IP range.
inet6 ::1/128
inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fe1f:41e4/10
```

![inet](../images/install/txt/inet.png)

## SSH and install start.

Next open a ``terminal`` on another computer
(or your favorite ``ssh`` client **IF** you're on windows) and connect.

- The ``username`` is ``jack`` and the ``password`` is ``openindiana``

```bash
adrian@am1m-s2h:~$ ssh jack@192.168.0.20
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.20 (192.168.0.20)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is c9:41:f8:75:3a:2c:78:d5:b0:a4:04:7d:ae:94:74:a1.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.0.20' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

jack@openindiana:~$
```

![ssh-into](../images/install/txt/ssh-into.png)

now that you're ``sshed`` into the OpenIndiana ``live`` system you can initiate
the ``text install``.

To do so enter:

```bash
jack@openindiana:~$ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/text-install
```

You will be prompted for a ``password``, the password is ``openindiana``


![start text install](../images/install/txt/initialize-text-install.png)

Take a moment to read if you need to and when you're ready press ``F2`` to continue.

## Disk partitioning/management

Now you can ``partition`` your ``disk`` or just use the whole disk.
(use ``arrow`` keys to navigate menus)

![partition screen one](../images/install/txt/partitionscreen3.png)

## Network setup

Now you can setup your ``hostname``(Computer Name)
and how your ``network`` is setup.

![set hostname](../images/install/txt/network1.png)

your ``time zone``

![time zone](../images/install/txt/tz3.png)

and finally make sure the ``date`` and ``time`` is correct

![time zone](../images/install/txt/tz4.png)
