# Install OpenIndiana (Hipster)


![Select keyboard layout](images/install/gui/SKL.png)

Here put in whatever number is next to your keyboard layout name.(e.g. 47 for US-English, 46 for UK-English, etc.)

![Select display language](images/install/gui/SDL.png)

Here is pretty much the same as the last step, but this sets the display language.(i.e. what language the user-interface is in)

![First Install Screen](images/install/gui/OGI.png)

As soon as the desktop loads, click "Install OpenIndiana" and this screen will appear, click next. (if you get error dialogue boxes, just close them)

![Disk Menu](images/install/gui/SIL.png)

Here you can just select "Use the whole disk" if you're only going to install OpenIndiana on this system, otherwise you can Selection "Parition the disk" and partition it accordingly.

![Time Zone, Date and Time](images/install/gui/SDAT.png)

On this screen you select your region, location, timezone, date, and time. Also whether you want 24 hour or 12 hour time.

![Locale](images/install/gui/SL.png)

This screen is for seting up the locale which controls things like default language support, date formats, etc.

![Users](images/install/gui/SMUD.png)

Enter your root password, your "real name", "username" and your users password, Also set a hostname(computer-name).

![Waiting game](images/install/gui/ISS.png)

And now you play the waiting game, the system is now seting up itself/installing. Go make a cup of coffee, snuggle a loved one, or something! It might be a while.

![Ding, OS is ready](images/install/gui/FIS.png)

Your installation of OpenIndiana installed correctly,(at least I hope so!)you can now reboot into your new shiny system!
